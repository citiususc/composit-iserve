## ComposIT-iServe

ComposIT-iServe is an integration module that enables making use of ComposIT (https://github.com/citiususc/composit) 
for directly composing services indexed by iServe (https://github.com/kmi/iserve). 
This project supports composing semantic services with good performance without requiring loading all the service 
descriptions in memory. Service discovery and matchmaking tasks are delegated to iServe, which is especially 
focused on providing semantic service discovery support, while the actual composition is carried out by ComposIT. 
In order to use ComposIT-iServe you will need to get yourself a copy of both ComposIT and iServe.
